Through me the way into the suffering city,
Through me the way to the eternal pain,
Through me the way that runs among the lost.

Justice urged on my exalted Creator;
Divine Power made me,
The Supreme Wisdom, and the Primal Love.

Before me nothing was created,
That is not eternal;
And eternal I endure.

Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
